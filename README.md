# DEFT for Tic-Tac-Toe

![poster for movie Cloud Atlas](cloud_atlas.jpg)

The Python code in this repo generates 
a Tic-Tac-Toe example of the DEFT 
(DAG extraction from Text) algorithm proposed in
the following paper:

* [Causal DAG extraction from a library of books
or videos/movies](https://qbnets.wordpress.com/2022/10/16/my-new-paper-entitled-causal-dag-extraction-from-a-library-of-books-or-videos-movies/), by Robert R. Tucci

The repo includes a Jupyter notebook
[(here)](https://github.com/rrtucci/deft-tic-tac-toe/blob/master/deft_tic_tac_toe.ipynb) 
that 
takes the software through its paces.
